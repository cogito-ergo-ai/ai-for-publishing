# AI for Publishing - Article Generation Tool

## Introduction
AI for Publishing is a proof of concept (POC) project aimed at automating the creation of articles. It's designed to work with a knowledge base supplied by the user, ensuring the generation of content that respects Intellectual Property (IP) rights. This POC is part of the article series "...tbd...".

## Key Concept
The core idea of this project is to generate articles that are IP-safe. Users provide a knowledge base consisting of articles already vetted for IP compliance. Our tool then leverages this database to create new content, inheriting the IP safety of the original sources.

Certainly! I'll revise the README.md to avoid bullet points in the "Getting Started" section, especially since each step only contains one item. Here's the updated version:

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup
**Initialize Environment**: Setup you python environment (suggested python3.11) and install all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Vector Database
**Launch Vector DB (Qdrant)**: Use Docker to run the Qdrant database. This database is vital for storing and managing the knowledge base.
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -ti qdrant/qdrant
```

### Knowledge Base Ingestion
**Ingest Knowledge Base**: Populate the Qdrant database with articles to form your knowledge base. These articles will be utilized by the AI model to generate new content.
```bash
python src/ingest.py http://url/to/pdf1 /path/to/local/pdf2
```

### Starting the AI Bot
**Activate the AI Bot**: Start the bot to engage in an interactive chat for article generation.
```bash
python src/bot.py
```
